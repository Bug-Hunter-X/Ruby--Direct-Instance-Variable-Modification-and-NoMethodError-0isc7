This repository demonstrates two common Ruby errors: directly modifying instance variables and attempting to call a non-existent method. The `bug.rb` file showcases these issues, while `bugSolution.rb` offers improved practices.  Direct instance variable modification can make code harder to maintain and debug, while calling non-existent methods results in runtime errors.  The solutions provided highlight safer and more robust approaches.
